;; Using DOM, focus the target block.

;; The same unique datascript block can be rendered multiple times: node-page, right sidebar, linked/unlinked references
;; In this case, find the all the potential HTML blocks with that uid. The one that shares the same closest ancestor as the
;; activeElement (where the text caret is before the new focus happens), is the container of the block to focus on.

;; If an index is passed, set cursor to that index.
