If you disagree with Athens's values, Athens's Discord guidelines, or the official Discord policies, you have two options: [Voice or Exit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A).

# Values
> Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.

— Epictetus

Athens is not just a product. Athens is a community for collaboration and learning.

When participating in the Athens community, you are agreeing to embody Athens's values. But values and communities become real through actions, not words. As Athens matures, we will add epics and hero's journeys that exemplify Athens's values to this page.

## Collaboration

> Associate with people who are likely to improve you.

— Seneca

## Learning

> The object of education is to teach us to love what is beautiful.

— Plato

# Athens Discord

## Inviting

Athenians are free to invite others to the Athens Discord, but the Core Team and Guardians reserve the right to revoke this permission.

This would be necessary in case there were growing pains from premature scaling or in the case of bad actors trying to disrupt the Athens Discord with spambots.

This is also why invites expire after 24 hours by default.

## Kicking and Banning

If there are spambots or members severely transgressing the Athens values and guidelines, it is the responsibility of Guardians and Core Team members to kick or ban these bad actors.

If it is unclear why the kick or ban was necessary, a DM will be sent to follow-up on this event and clarify the rationale.

Kicking removes the user from the server. The user can be re-invited and then rejoin.

Banning is a permanent removal from the server. Particularly effective for spambots.

## Auto-Moderation

[Probot](probot.io) is used for auto-moderation.

It warns members in the following cases:

- Emoji spam
- Duplicated text
- Bad words
- Spammed caps (70% > caps)
- Mass mention (@everyone)

It warns members and deletes messages in the following cases:

- Spam (5 messages / 5 sec)

## Pruning

Collaboration implies participation. Members of the Discord who do not message after a certain number of days are "pruned" and will need to be re-invited to rejoin the Discord.

## Contributor Channels

In the "Athens (Product)" section, we have set up specific channels for those who have made non-trivial contributions to engineering and/or design. This way, communications between contributors can flow freely, while still allowing aspiring contributors to gain invaluable context about how and why certain decisions are made. More context about this change in our Discord can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/athensresearch/Open-Source-Conversations-Discord-a8c959de3b194cefadd48b497fc12079).
