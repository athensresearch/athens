## Getting Started

Setup instructions can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
You will need:
- a `java` sdk: I'm using [openjdk 11.0.2](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)
- `lein`: Clojure's main [package manager](https://leiningen.org/) (lein installs the correct version of Clojure for you)
- `yarn` or `npm`: I'm using [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)

Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. `yarn install`
3. `lein dev`
4. Go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
