### Private

You can use Athens as a local desktop app that saves data to your filesystem or with a [self-hosted server](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens-backend).

### Extensible

You can modify Athens's source code. We are planning to build custom themes, keybdindings, and integrations with other services.

### Community-Driven

Athens has a Discord with over 2,200 members. We do support and feature development on Discord and GitHub. Every Sunday at 11am Pacific, we have a community call. [Join us](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V)!

# Problem

The problem with notetaking apps like Evernote, Microsoft OneNote, or Apple Notes is that once you write a note, you never look at it again. Without any organization, you're stuck praying that search will work for your future self. On the other hand, creating and following a system requires way too much discipline.

Athens lets you take notes without needing systems or structure, letting you stay creative and in flow state. Athens does this with [[bidirectional links]] and ((block references)) that allow you to take notes on anything, from anywhere, and connect them easily together.

# [Pricing](https://opencollective.com/athens)

Athens is free to use as a local-only desktop app. We are currently building out a hosted software service that will start at $6/month. We have a self-hosted/on-premise option for enterprises that need to self-host, comparable to GitLab or Mattermost. If you are using Athens commercially, please contact us at researchathens@gmail.com.
