## Use Athens

Athens persists data to your local filesystem.

If you want to try Athens, you have two options:

1. Build locally via the directions in [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).
1. Sponsor the project and join the [waitlist](https://forms.gle/9L1D1T7R3G7pvh1e7)! The beta is currently being rolled out, first to Sponsors and Contributors, and then to those on the waitlist.

## [Contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)

To run the development build of Athens, follow the instructions in [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) and checkout our [Project Board](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/projects/2#column-9464291). If you're new to Clojure, [join ClojureFam](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam). Before creating issues, please ask in our Discord ðŸ‘‡

## [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V)

Our Discord community is a space for [collaboration and learning](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#values) (especially about Clojure!).

We chat about other Tools for Thought, [graph visualizations](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/21), [graph DBs, decentralized DBs](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/9), blockchains, [open protocols, knowledge markets](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/VISION.md#a-protocol-for-knowledge-markets), [education](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/doc/ClojureFam.md), philosophy, and governance.

We also love [Future of Coding topics](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/046#question-thirteen-what-foc-topics-interest-you-most) such as visual programming, live programming, [local first apps](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html), [end-user programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming.html), programming language theory, HCI, AR / VR / spatial software, AI / ML, and so on and so forth.

Ultimately, however, we recognize technology does not exist in a vaccum. Technology shapes society as much as vice versa. There are never no externalities. If you are interested in "**sensemaking**" towards a better world, please join us!
