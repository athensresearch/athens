# Join Us

If you have any input on how you want this project to unfold, please join our Discord.

You don't need to code to contribute. But it is encouraged. 😉

Our Discord community is a space for collaboration and learning (especially about Clojure!).

We chat about other Tools for Thought, [graph visualizations](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/21), [graph DBs, decentralized DBs, local first apps](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/9), blockchains, [open protocols, knowledge markets](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/VISION.md#a-protocol-for-knowledge-markets), [education](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/doc/ClojureFam.md), philosophy, and governance.

We also love [Future of Coding topics](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/046#question-thirteen-what-foc-topics-interest-you-most) such as visual programming, live programming, end-user programming, programming language theory, HCI, AR / VR / spatial software, AI / ML, and so on and so forth.

Ultimately, however, we recognize technology does not exist in a vaccum. Technology shapes society as much as vice versa. There are never no externalities. If you are interested in "sensemaking" towards a better world, please join us!
