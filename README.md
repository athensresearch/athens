# What is Athens

Athens is an open-source and local-first alternative to [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/). Athens is the most community-driven, private, and extensible knowledge graph.

# ðŸš€ [Download the free desktop app](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/releases) ðŸš€

(Do not auto-update with the Mac M1. Right now M1 build auto-updates to Intel. This is a problem with Electron Builder and we are looking into it.)

### Open-Source

- The freedom to self-host
- The freedom to use any previous version of Athens for the rest of time
- Insurance against vendor lock-in
- Transparency and direct feedback loops in the [development](https://loom.com/share/folder/5582cfd8099a4dbda63b61213d5d9152) [process](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues)

### Local-First

- 0% data loss
- 0% downtime
- 100% availability
- 100% local and fast unlike server-first apps (*cough* Notion and Roam)

## Knowledge Graph

The problem with notetaking apps like Evernote or Apple Notes is that once you write a note, after a week you never look at it again. Without any organization, you're stuck praying that search will work for your future self. On the other hand, creating and following a system requires way too much discipline.

Athens lets you take notes with minimal systems, structure, and organization, freeing you to stay creative and in flow state. Athens does this with [[bidirectional links]], ((block references)), and a graph database.
