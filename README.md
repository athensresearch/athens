# What is Athens

Athens is an open-source and local-first alternative to [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/). Athens lets you take notes with minimal systems, structure, and organization, freeing you to stay creative and in flow state.

Athens is a desktop app that stores all your data locally and privately on your local filesystem.

Athens is free for individuals to self-host.

# [Join Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V)

Our Discord community is a space for [collaboration and learning](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#values) (especially about Clojure!).

Every Sunday we have a Community Call at 11am Pacific.

We chat about other Tools for Thought, [graph visualizations](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/21), [graph DBs, decentralized DBs](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/9), blockchains, [open protocols, knowledge markets](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/VISION.md#a-protocol-for-knowledge-markets), [education](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/doc/ClojureFam.md), philosophy, and governance.

We also love [Future of Coding topics](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/046#question-thirteen-what-foc-topics-interest-you-most) such as visual programming, live programming, [local first apps](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html), [end-user programming](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming.html), programming language theory, HCI, AR / VR / spatial software, AI / ML, and so on and so forth.

Ultimately, however, we recognize technology does not exist in a vaccum. Technology shapes society as much as vice versa. There are never no externalities. If you are interested in "**sensemaking**" towards a better world, please join us!
