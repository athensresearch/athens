# Athens

Athens is an open-source, self-hosted app for research and notetaking. Outline your ideas, connect them with links and embedded content, and build a personal knowledge database without having to worry about organizing your thoughts. Athens makes your writing more useful over time by making it easy to find and learn from again.

Athens solves the [big problem](#problem) with information overload while _also_ being open-source, [private](#private), [extensible](#extensible), and [community-driven](#community-driven). We have a much larger [vision](https://athensresearch.gitbook.io/handbook/community/about/vision) for self-hosting, bi-directional links, collective knowledge, and learning in public.

## Problem

We're getting drowned in information. If we don't take notes, we forget everything, and when we do take notes, we have too many! Search doesn't work. Folders and sub-sub-sub-folders don't work. And no one properly #tags their notes.

Athens lets you take notes without praying to the search gods, without double-clicking endlessly on folders, and without manual tagging.

Athens does this with **[[bidirectional links]]** and **((block references))**, which are like hyperlinks and embeds with superpowers. Just [[link]] or ((reference)) another page or block‚Äîand voil√†!‚Äîyou've now connected two of your ideas, and can see all the other places that _link back_ to these pages. The next time you press `[[` or `((`, you'll be indexing through your previous notes, helping you connect the dots. You've started creating a graph of your knowledge!

### Private

The [Athens desktop app](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/releases) saves your notes to your local filesystem (and edit on multiple system with a syncing tool like Dropbox), or use the [self-hosted server](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens-backend). You always own the content of your knowledge graph.

### Extensible

Athens' source code is open and we're [accepting contributions](#contributing). We're also building a plugin system for custom themes, keybindings, and integrations with other data sources.

### Community-driven

Athens has a Discord server with over 2,500 members. [Joining our Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) is the easiest way to chat with other members of the Athens community and learn about what's going on.

Everyone is welcome to join our weekday standups at 11:30am Eastern time to learn more about what core team members and contributors are working on.
We have a community call every Sunday at 2pm Eastern time. [Put it on your calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=cmVzZWFyY2hhdGhlbnNAZ21haWwuY29t) and join us! You can help shape the future of notetaking and knowledge graphs.
