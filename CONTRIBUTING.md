# Contributing to Athens

## Developers

- Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) ðŸ‘¾ and check out the `#engineering` and `#engineers` channels. The former is for anything engineering-related, and the latter is for [contributors](./GOVERNANCE.md#contributors) who have already made non-trivial code contributions.
  - Post work updates in the `#build-in-public`. This keeps the team on the same page! Let's avoid stepping on each others toes, minimize blockers / dependencies, and cheer each other on!
- Watch the repo and bookmark our [Project Board](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/projects/2). This is the ultimate source of truth for product roadmapping.
- To start working on your PR, you have a few ways to get started:
    1. ask a question in our `#engineering` [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) channel
    1. comment on one of the existing top-level issues on the project board
    1. create a PR draft or issue, then assign yourself (prefer drafts over new issues)
- In all the cases above, try to scope out what you want to do and how, to the extent that you can at the start of a task! If you aren't sure about the scopes, chat in our Discord. If you feel confident, go ahead and start your PR draft â€” you don't need permission to start!
- Read [Product Development at Athens](https://www.notion.so/athensresearch/Product-Development-at-Athens-4c99e37d1713441c99360668c39e5db7) to see our shipping philosophy. It's more nuanced than just "agile", with some inspiration from Basecamp. ðŸ› 
- If you don't have experience programming with Clojure, checkout our learning resources and join [ClojureFam](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam) to learn with some friends! In our experience, it takes ~4 weeks of part-time study to begin making solid code contributions to Athens.

## Designers

- Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) ðŸ‘¾ and see what's happening in the `#design` and `#designers` channel. The former is for anything design-related, and the latter is for [contributors](./GOVERNANCE.md#contributors) who have already made non-trivial design contributions.
- Duplicate the [Athens Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/XITWUHZHNJsIbcCsBkOHpZ/Athens-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1) on Figma to get the building blocks for creating UIs and workflows.
- See previous concepts in the [Product Design Sandbox](https://www.figma.com/file/iCXP6z7H5IAQ6xyFr5AbZ7/Product-Design-Sandbox?node-id=183%3A37). This Figma is no longer actively used, but seeing previous work can help!


## Others

- Have other superpowers?! Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V) ðŸ‘¾, introduce yourself in `#introductions`, and ask around in `#agora`!

# Running Athens Locally

These dependencies are needed to get Athens up and running. To install them, follow the instructions in the links.

1. [Java 11 and Leiningen](https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/how-to-install-clojure/) (Leiningen installs Clojure)
1. [Node 12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

*If you want to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), [try this tutorial](https://www.notion.so/Beginner-Clojure-Environment-Setup-Windows-36f70c16b9a7420da3cd797a3eb712fa#6a53854de58d4f07ba6319d868fba29c).*

After you've got these dependencies, clone the Git repository to your hard drive:

```
git clone https://github.com/athensresearch/athens.git
```

Then `cd athens/` and run the following commands.

Pull JavaScript dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Pull Java dependencies and build, then start a local HTTP server for Athens:

```
lein dev
```

When these scripts are done, your terminal will read `build complete`. Athens can then be accessed by pointing a browser to http://localhost:3000/ on UNIX or http://127.0.0.1:3000/ on Windows.

## Running in Docker

For a quick way to get up and started with a local development environment you can also use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) via the corresponding [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).
In order to do so, build a Docker image and run it like this:

```
docker build -t athens .
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -p 8777:8777 -p 9630:9630 athens
```

# Deploying Athens and Devcards

You should deploy your version of Athens and [Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) if you are making UI-releated pull requests to Athens. This will allow developers and designers to interact with your code, which is essential for reviewing UI changes.

Athens Devcards can be found at https://athensresearch.github.io/athens/cards.html.

## Automated Deploys

We've setup GitHub Actions so that each time you commit to your fork on GitHub, GitHub Actions automatically lints, tests, and styles your code.

If these scripts pass, GitHub builds your code and then deploys it to https://YOUR_GITHUB.github.io/athens/ and https://YOUR_GITHUB.github.io/athens/cards.html.

To begin doing automated deploys, just make sure your Actions are enabled at https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB/athens/actions. Then start pushing code!

## Manual Deploys

To build and deploy Athens and Devcards from your local development environment:

1. Build your JavaScript bundle(s) with either `lein dev`, `lein devcards`, or `lein compile`.
1. Run `lein gh-pages`.
1. Open http://<YOUR_GITHUB>/github.io/athens/ and http://<YOUR_GITHUB>/github.io/athens/cards.html. Sometimes this takes a minute to be updated.

Notes:

- If you want to compile Athens and Devcards one time without hot-reloading, run `lein compile`.
- If you are actively developing Athens and not Devcards, run `lein dev` to hot-reload the Athens application.
- If you are actively developing DevCards and not Athens, run `lein devcards` to hot-reload Devcards.
- If you want to build Athens and Devcards, because you are testing a component on DevCards and Athens at the same time, you should run `lein dev` and `lein devcards` in two terminals.
- If both builds are running, it doesn't matter which port you go to (i.e. `3000` or `3001`), because both HTTP servers can serve assets.
- More docs should be written in the future on how to connect a REPL to either build, depending on your text editor.

# Connecting your REPL

* Make sure you can run Athens locally before proceeding with this section.
* Refer to shadow-cljs [editor integration docs](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_editor_integration) for more details.
* nREPL port is 8777, as defined in [shadow-cljs.edn](./shadow-cljs.edn).

# Using re-frame-10x

The right sidebar has [`re-frame-10x`](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-10x/tree/master/src/day8) developer tools. You can toggle it open and close with `ctrl-h`.

This is useful for inspecting the state of re-frame apps. However, we are currently reducing usage on re-frame-10x because it doesn't work well with datascript ([#139](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/139)).


# Running CI Scripts Locally

After each submitted PR to Athens, GitHub Actions runs the continuous integration workflow declared in `.github/workflows/build.yml`. This workflow runs scripts from [`script/`](script) to test, lint, and build Athens. You can see these workflows in practice in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/actions/).

However, it's a lot faster if you run these tests locally, so you don't have to submit a PR each time to make sure the workflow succeeds. You may need to install additional dependencies, though.

## Testing

No additional installation is needed. Just run this:

```
lein test
```

The output will look something like this:

```
$ lein test

Testing athens.block-test

Testing athens.parser-test

Testing athens.patterns-test

Ran 4 tests containing 16 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

## Linting

We are linting Clojure code using [clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo). Our clj-kondo configuration is in [`.clj-kondo/config.edn`](.clj-kondo/config.edn).

For this linting to work, you will need to install `clj-kondo`. Instructions are in [`clj-kondo`â€™s installation guide](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/install.md).

To see the problems reported by clj-kondo, run `script/lint`. Example run:

```
$ script/lint
linting took 257ms, errors: 0, warnings: 0
```

Your editor may also be able to integrate with clj-kondoâ€™s output. For example, if you use [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) for VS Code, then clj-kondoâ€™s messages are reported in the Problems panel.

## Clojure Styling

To format your code or check that your code is formatted correctly, you will need to use `cljstyle`. Instructions for installing it are [in `cljstyle`â€™s README](https://github.com/greglook/cljstyle/tree/master#installation).

To check if your Clojure code is formatted correctly, run `cljstyle check`. If there is no output and the return code is zero, youâ€™re good. You can also run `script/style`, but currently it only works if youâ€™re running Linux.

To reformat all your Clojure files in place, run `cljstyle fix`.

## Unused Variable Checking

To set this up, first make sure that a global `clojure` binary is installed. You wonâ€™t necessarily have a `clojure` binary installed just because you installed Leiningen.

Next, just run `script/carve`. The first time you run it it will download [Carve](https://github.com/borkdude/carve) as a dependency, which takes about a minute and outputs lots of messages. On subsequent runs `script/carve` wonâ€™t output anything unless an unused variable was found.
