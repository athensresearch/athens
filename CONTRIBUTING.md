# Clojure Style Guide

# Git Style Guide

## Commits

Follow guidelines from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Specifically, begin each commit with one of the following types:


```
build:
ci:
chore:
docs:
feat:
fix:
perf:
refactor:
revert:
style:
test:
```

After you specify the type, write a declarative statement in the present tense explaining what you did. Add additional detail in bullets below the header. Example:

```
feat: implement new right side bar

- see issue for details on CSS library
- TODO: fix padding
```

## Issues

Do not just write an issue because you have a question/problem. If you think you are missing some information, ask in the #engineering or #learning channel of the Discord.

On the other hand, if you believe there is an issue with source code, please write an actionable issue with this [template](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/new?title=Descriptive+issue+title&body=%23%23%23%23+Description%0AA+clear+and+concise+description+of+what+the+issue+is+about.%0A%0A%23%23%23%23+Screenshots%0A!%5BShaq+Kitty+Wiggle%5D(https://media.giphy.com/media/13CoXDiaCcCoyk/giphy.gif)%0A%0A%23%23%23%23+Files%0AA+list+of+relevant+files+for+this+issue.+This+will+help+people+navigate+the+project+and+offer+some+clues+of+where+to+start.%0A%0A%23%23%23%23+To+Reproduce%0AIf+this+issue+is+describing+a+bug,+include+some+steps+to+reproduce+the+behavior.%0A%0A%23%23%23%23+Tasks%0AInclude+specific+tasks+in+the+order+they+need+to+be+done+in.+Include+links+to+specific+lines+of+code+where+the+task+should+happen+at.%0A-+%5B+%5D+Task+1%0A-+%5B+%5D+Task+2%0A-+%5B+%5D+Task+3%0A%0ARemember+to+use+labels.).

Better yet, submit a pull request.

## Pull Requests

If your PR is related to other issue(s), reference it by issue number. You can close issues smoothly with [Github keywords](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords):

```
close #1
fix #2
resolve #2
```

Those with merge permissions should "Squash and Merge" as a general rule of thumb. This makes reverts easier if they are needed.
