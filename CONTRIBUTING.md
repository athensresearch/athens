# Contributing to Athens

Whether you are a designer, developer, or have other superpowers, please see our [v1 Project Board](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/projects/2) to see what we're working on.

- The best place to reach us is our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V)! ðŸ‘¾
- Read [Product Development at Athens](https://www.notion.so/athensresearch/Product-Development-at-Athens-4c99e37d1713441c99360668c39e5db7) to see our shipping philosophy. It's more nuanced than just "agile", with some inspiration from Basecamp. ðŸ› 

# Running Athens Locally

These dependencies are needed to get Athens up and running. To install them, follow the instructions in the links.

1. [Java 11 and Leiningen](https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/how-to-install-clojure/) (Leiningen installs Clojure)
1. [Node 12](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)

After you've got these dependencies, clone the Git repository to your hard drive:

```
git clone https://github.com/athensresearch/athens.git
```

Then `cd athens/` and run the following commands.

Pull JavaScript dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Pull Java dependencies and build, then start a local HTTP server for Athens:

```
lein dev
```

When these scripts are done, your terminal will read `build complete`. Athens can then be accessed by pointing a browser to http://localhost:3000/ on UNIX or http://127.0.0.1:3000/ on Windows.

# Deploying Athens and Devcards

You should deploy your version of Athens and [Devcards](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards) if you are making pull requests to Athens. This will allow developers and designers to interact with your code, which is essential for reviewing UI changes.

The official Athens Devcards can be found at https://athensresearch.github.io/athens/cards.html.

To build and deploy Athens and Devcards:

1. Run `lein dev` as above. Your app is running at http://localhost:3000, and your shadow-cljs server is running at http://localhost:9630.
1. Run `lein devcards` in a separate terminal. It's okay if you see warning logs. Because `lein dev` is already running, the Devcards build finds the next available ports â€” http://localhost:3001 and http://localhost:9631 for the app and shadow-cljs, respectively.
1. Open http://localhost:3000/ and http://localhost:3001/cards.html. You should see Athens and Devcards, respectively.
1. Run `lein gh-pages` in a third terminal.
1. Open http://<YOUR_GITHUB>/github.io/athens/ and http://<YOUR_GITHUB>/github.io/athens/cards.html. Sometimes this takes a minute to be updated. If both work, then you have successfuly deployed your Athens and Devcards for the world to see! 

Notes:

- If you are only developing on Athens and not Devcards, you only need to run `lein dev`.
- If you are only developing on DevCards and not Athens, you only need to run `lein devcards`.
- However, if you want to build both because you are testing a component on DevCards and Athens at the same time, you should run both.
- If both builds are running, it doesn't matter which port you go to (i.e. `3000` or `3001`), because both HTTP servers can serve assets.
- More docs should be written in the future on how to connect a REPL to either build, depending on your text editor.

# Connecting your REPL

- [ ] TODO: write this section for each editor (Cursive, CIDER, Calva, Fireplace, etc.)

# Using re-frame-10x

The right sidebar has [`re-frame-10x`](https://github.com/day8/re-frame-10x/tree/master/src/day8) developer tools. You can toggle it open and close with `ctrl-h`.

This is useful for inspecting the state of re-frame apps. However, we are currently reducing usage on re-frame-10x because it doesn't work well with datascript ([#139](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/139)).


# Running CI Scripts Locally

After each submitted PR to Athens, GitHub Actions runs the continuous integration workflow declared in `.github/workflows/build.yml`. This workflow runs scripts from [`script/`](script) to test, lint, and build Athens. You can see these workflows in practice in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/actions/).

However, it's a lot faster if you run these tests locally, so you don't have to submit a PR each time to make sure the workflow succeeds. You may need to install additional dependencies, though.

## Testing

No additional installation is needed. Just run this:

```
lein test
```

The output will look something like this:

```
$ lein test

Testing athens.block-test

Testing athens.parser-test

Testing athens.patterns-test

Ran 4 tests containing 16 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

## Linting

We are linting Clojure code using [clj-kondo](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo). Our clj-kondo configuration is in [`.clj-kondo/config.edn`](.clj-kondo/config.edn).

For this linting to work, you will need to install `clj-kondo`. Instructions are in [`clj-kondo`â€™s installation guide](https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/install.md).

To see the problems reported by clj-kondo, run `script/lint`. Example run:

```
$ script/lint
linting took 257ms, errors: 0, warnings: 0
```

Your editor may also be able to integrate with clj-kondoâ€™s output. For example, if you use [Calva](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=betterthantomorrow.calva) for VS Code, then clj-kondoâ€™s messages are reported in the Problems panel.

## Clojure Styling

To format your code or check that your code is formatted correctly, you will need to use `cljstyle`. Instructions for installing it are [in `cljstyle`â€™s README](https://github.com/greglook/cljstyle/tree/master#installation).

To check if your Clojure code is formatted correctly, run `cljstyle check`. If there is no output and the return code is zero, youâ€™re good. You can also run `script/style`, but currently it only works if youâ€™re running Linux.

To reformat all your Clojure files in place, run `cljstyle fix`.

## Unused Variable Checking

To set this up, first make sure that a global `clojure` binary is installed. You wonâ€™t necessarily have a `clojure` binary installed just because you installed Leiningen.

Next, just run `script/carve`. The first time you run it it will download [Carve](https://github.com/borkdude/carve) as a dependency, which takes about a minute and outputs lots of messages. On subsequent runs `script/carve` wonâ€™t output anything unless an unused variable was found.

# Git and GitHub Style Guide

## Commits

Follow guidelines from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Specifically, begin each commit with one of the following types:

```
build:
ci:
chore:
docs:
feat:
fix:
perf:
refactor:
revert:
style:
test:
```

See some real examples in our [commit history](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/commits/master).

## Issues

Please create issues using [our templates](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/new/choose). However, you will almost certainly get feedback and help faster in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GCJaV3V)!


## Pull Requests

If your PR is related to other issue(s), reference it by issue number. You can close issues smoothly with [GitHub keywords](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords):

```
close #1
fix #2
resolve #2
```

This repo only allows those with merge permissions to "Squash and Merge" PRs. This makes reverts easier if they are needed.
