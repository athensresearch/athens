# Overview

This project is led by a [Benevolent Dictator](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel), otherwise known as the project lead, and Core Team. Together, they will make the strategic decisions for the high-level, at times overlapping, domains that a technology organization needs to manage in order to function and succeed. These domains include, but are not limited to: engineering, design, product, strategy, operations, training and education, finance, legal, administration, and communications.

This project is *radically open* to contributions, feedback, and input from the community, following the "Bazaar" model described in Eric S. Raymond's, "[The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain)".

Even within the [meritocratic open-source software governance model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel), "not everyone has a binding vote". Therefore, those who want greater influence over the direction of Athens are encouraged to make greater contributions in any of the aforementioned domains to be considered as a candidate for the Core Team.

The Benevolent Dictator has executive power on strategic decisions. Strategic decisions are high-level decisions that will influence the direction of Athens for months or longer. This includes the addition or removal of Core Team members and Guardians. Over time, as the Core Team forms, they will have greater say over these strategic decisions. The Benevolent Dictator and Core Team may form their own internal structure and decision-making process, while still aligning optimally with the needs of the community.

These roles and others will be discussed in further detail below.

# Roles and Responsibilities

## Benevolent Dictator

> Forks, or rather the potential for forks, are the reason there are no true dictators in free software projects... Imagine a king whose subjects could copy his entire kingdom at any time and move to the copy to rule as they see fit. Would not such a king govern very differently from one whose subjects were bound to stay under his rule no matter what he did?" — [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/html-chunk/social-infrastructure.html#benevolent-dictator-qualifications)

The role of the project lead is to ensure that the project survives, if not thrives, long-term. The project lead does this by understanding the community as a whole, satisfying as many conflicting needs as possible, and articulating and exemplifying the shared [values]((https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)) and [vision](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/VISION.md) for the Athens project.

Thus, the role of the project lead is less about dictatorship and more about diplomacy. Because anyone can fork Athens at any time, the project lead is fully accountable to the Core Team, Guardians, and Athenians. The key to do doing this is to ensure that, as the project expands, the right people are given influence over it.

## Core Team

The Core Team is comprised of Athenians who have demonstrated impactful contributions and significant commitment to the Athens project.

Contributions include, but are not limited to, the aforementioned domains (engineering, design, etc.). The degree of impact will be evaluated by the Benevolent Dictator and Core Team.

Significant commitment means being an exemplary member of the Athens community. This requires upholding and championing the [Athens Values](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to a distinguished degree, not just for oneself but for others.

Significant commitment also means being dedicated oneself long-term to the actualization of the [Athens Vision](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/VISION.md).

## Contributors

Contributors will receive the beta application first as well as the newest updates as the product matures, as explained in [MVP Update, Funding, and Why I Started Athens](https://www.notion.so/MVP-Update-Funding-and-Why-I-Started-Athens-e68822f0c3654660ae621cdcbf932bc4).

### Work

The main opportunities to contribute currently are through design, engineering, and product. By contributing non-trivial designs (Figma) and code (Clojure) to the project, you will gain write-access to three channels: `#engineers`, `#designers`, and `#product`. Read more at [Open Source Conversations](https://www.notion.so/athensresearch/Open-Source-Conversations-Discord-a8c959de3b194cefadd48b497fc12079).

### Financial

Financial Contributors are those that sponsor the project for $16/month or more through [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/athens). They will provide feedback on the product, which will be especially crucial in its early stages.

### Other

As the product matures, it's likely we will need specific guidance in areas such as finance, legal, operations, etc. If you have these or other skills not mentioned already, and see an opportunity to apply them, join our Discord!

If you contribute interesting conversations, ideas, and feedback, and generally make our community a better place to be, that could also make you a Contibutor!


## Members


## Other Roles

Roles may be created, removed, and refactored in the future.

Note that the roles in this document are also represented in the Discord with varying levels of permissions. However, not all roles on Discord pertain to governance and are therefore not mentioned here, e.g. learners, mentors, intro-only
