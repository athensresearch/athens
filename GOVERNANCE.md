# Overview

This project is led by a [Benevolent Dictator](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel), otherwise known as the project lead, and Core Team. Together, they will make the strategic decisions for the high-level, at times overlapping, domains that a technology organization needs to manage in order to function and succeed. These domains include, but are not limited to: engineering, design, product, strategy, operations, training and education, finance, legal, administration, and communications.

This project is *radically open* to contributions, feedback, and input from the community, following the "Bazaar" model described in Eric S. Raymond's, "[The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain)".

Even within the [meritocratic open-source software governance model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel), "not everyone has a binding vote". Therefore, those who want greater influence over the direction of Athens are encouraged to make greater contributions in any of the aforementioned domains to be considered as a candidate for the Core Team.

The Benevolent Dictator has executive power on strategic decisions. Strategic decisions are high-level decisions that will influence the direction of Athens for months or longer. This includes the addition or removal of Core Team members and Guardians. Over time, as the Core Team forms, they will have greater say over these strategic decisions. The Benevolent Dictator and Core Team may form their own internal structure and decision-making process, while still aligning optimally with the needs of the community.

These roles and others will be discussed in further detail below.

# Roles and Responsibilities

## Benevolent Dictator

> Forks, or rather the potential for forks, are the reason there are no true dictators in free software projects... Imagine a king whose subjects could copy his entire kingdom at any time and move to the copy to rule as they see fit. Would not such a king govern very differently from one whose subjects were bound to stay under his rule no matter what he did?" â€” [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/html-chunk/social-infrastructure.html#benevolent-dictator-qualifications)

The role of the project lead is to ensure that the project survives, if not thrives, long-term. The project lead does this by understanding the community as a whole, satisfying as many conflicting needs as possible, and articulating and exemplifying the shared [values]((https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)) and [vision](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/VISION.md) for the Athens project.

Thus, the role of the project lead is less about dictatorship and more about diplomacy. Because anyone can fork Athens at any time, the project lead is fully accountable to the Core Team, Guardians, and Athenians. The key to do doing this is to ensure that, as the project expands, the right people are given influence over it.

## Core Team

The Core Team is comprised of Athenians who have demonstrated impactful contributions and significant commitment to the Athens project.

Contributions include, but are not limited to, the aforementioned domains (engineering, design, etc.). The degree of impact will be evaluated by the Benevolent Dictator and Core Team.

Significant commitment means being an exemplary member of the Athens community. This requires upholding and championing the [Athens Values](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to a distinguished degree, not just for oneself but for others.

Significant commitment also means being dedicated oneself long-term to the actualization of the [Athens Vision](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/blob/master/VISION.md).

## Moderators (Guardians)

Moderators, or Guardians, are also exemplary members of the Athens community. Specifically, Guardians are responsible for ensuring that members are [being excellent](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge_Vision#Excellence) to one another, in accordance with Athens's values. Guardians are responsible for de-escalating and resolving conflicts should they arise, in the event that Athenians are unable to do so themselves.

Guardians have high degrees of emotional intelligence, leadership, and compassion. They are invested in creating an atmosphere of psychological safety. You are always free to DM the Guardians if you are feeling unwell. In order to become a Guardian, you will need to practice setting up your own Discord server with bots. Ideally, you will also have experience doing conflict resolution and emotional labor.

## Contributors (Athenians)

Anyone who has agreed to the Athens guidelines and introduced themselves on the Athens Discord server is a Contributor, otherwise known as an Athenian.

Athenians engage with the project by contributing expertise in the aforementioned domains (engineering, design, etc.). They also contribute by sharing constructive, hopefully actionable feedback on Athens the product, Athens the community, and [related topics of interest](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens#join-us).

## Other Roles

Roles may be created, removed, and refactored in the future.

Note that the roles in this document are also represented in the Discord with varying levels of permissions. However, not all roles on Discord pertain to governance and are therefore not mentioned here.
